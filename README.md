# TLS_ConcurrentMemoryPool

这是我第一次编写的较大的C++项目，目的主要是加深对操作系统内存分配与管理的理解，同时掌握一些工程规范与技巧。

This is the first time I have written a large C++ project. The main purpose is to deepen the understanding of operating system memory allocation and management, and to master some engineering specifications and skills.
